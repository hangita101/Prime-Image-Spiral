# Prime Spiral

I saw this 3b1b video [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
I though it was intresting 
I did prime number generator [link](https://github.com/hangita101/Prime-Number-Generator)
Using that i create a list of prime numbers

to use it 

```rust
cargo run [path to image] [path to prime list]
```

Basically Convert list of primes to Polar coordinate
display that polar point into Cartesian System

  `(r,theta) -> (r*cos(theta),r*sin(theta))`
